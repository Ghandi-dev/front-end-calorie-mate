It is commonly used as a screening tool to categorize people into different weight groups such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity. While BMI provides a general indication of body fat levels, it does not consider muscle mass, bone density, or fat distribution, making it an estimate rather than a precise measurement of health."
